= Local design

Various tips for good code from the local structure point of view (as opposed to architectural design questions), that do not fit in the other categories on this site.

== Avoid numerous parameters
Avoid method with numerous parameters, especially if they are of the same type. It increases the risk of passing a parameter for another one. For example, avoid `buildPerson(firstName: String, lastName: String, description: String, phoneNumber: String, address: String)` (use a https://codereview.stackexchange.com/a/127509[builder] instead).

== Choose your return types wisely
When a method returns a narrow type rather than a more general one (for example, `ImmutableList` instead of `List` or `Collection`), it makes it possibly more useful for the user: it documents more precisely what the returned type permits to do. On the other hand, it ties your implementation more strongly, as it better specifies the service that your method offers.

Sometimes, the best choice will depend on the specific details of your method or its intended usage. But some choices may be usually bad: if a type is more specific but does not offer much more capabilities, it is a bad choice. For example, there is generally no reason to return `ArrayList`.

Favor returning https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/ImmutableCollectionsExplained[`Immutable*`] collection kinds, to promote http://www.javapractices.com/topic/TopicAction.do?Id=29[immutability] in your application.

== Factor
In algebra, you factor an expression such as `ax+bx+cx` by transforming it into `x(a+b+c)`. View this as a way of not repeating yourself: we say only once to multiply by `x`. Similarly, you can often factor your code. When two methods have some code in common, and only differ by a small portion, there is certainly a way of putting what is common to both methods in a method, and let both methods call this one method, or re-use the code in some other way. You thereby make your code more concise (thus easier to understand and verify) and make sure that there is only one place to change if you spot a bug.

== Favor static factory methods
Static factory methods are static methods that play the role of constructors (hence the name factory) from the point of view of the user of your class.
See https://www.baeldung.com/java-constructors-vs-static-factory-methods[here] for the reasons for favoring static factory methods over constructors in your public interface.
Examples: `String.valueOf(true);`, `Integer.valueOf(3);`, `ImmutableList.of();`, `String.link:https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/String.html#format(java.lang.String,java.lang.Object...)[format]("Person name: %s, id: %d", name, id);`.
Use the following idiom (or an appropriate variant).

[source,java]
----
public class MyClass {
	public static MyClass given(int someParameter) {
		return new MyClass(someParameter);
	}
	
	private MyClass(int someParameter) {
		/** basic initializationâ€¦ */
	}
}

== The `#toString()` method
Consider overriding `#toString()` on your model classes, and use the Guava https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/CommonObjectUtilitiesExplained#tostring[helper] to implement it. Favor the form `MoreObjects.toStringHelper(this)`.

== The `#equals(Object)` method
Consider overriding `#equals(Object)` on your model classes. Use the following idiom.

[source,java]
----
@Override
public boolean equals(Object o2) {
	if (!(o2 instanceof Person)) {
		return false;
	}
	if (this == o2) {
		return true;
	}
	Person p2 = (Person) o2;
	return firstName.equals(p2.firstName) && secondName.equals(p2.secondName);
}
----

If the fields may be `null`, use https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Objects.html#equals(java.lang.Object,java.lang.Object){emptyattribute}[`Objects.equals(Object, Object)`] instead.

== The `#hashCode()` method
If you override `#equals(Object)`, you must override `#hashCode()` as well. Use simply something like: `return Objects.link:https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Objects.html#hashCode(java.lang.Object)[hashCode](firstName, secondName)`.
