The entry page of the Java course in L3.

== Prerequisites
You know algorithmics and, preferrably, the basic syntax of Java (or a related language). If you have followed an algorithmics course with illustrations and exercices in Java, you satisfy the prerequisites.

== Abbreviations

* [I]: Important
* [O]: Optional (do it if you are specifically interested in the related aspect)
* ESx.y (or ESx.y.z): designates section x.y (or x.y.z) in Eck’s http://math.hws.edu/javanotes/[book] (in chapter x)
* EQx: quiz chapter x
* EQx.y: question number y in Eck’s book, from quiz chapter x
* EEx.y: exercice number y in Eck’s book, from exercices chapter x
* Ranges are always given with ends included (EQ1.3 to 1.9 means 3 and 9 included)
* Markers apply to the whole line. Example: "4.3 intro to 4.3.2, 4.6.1 [I]" means that everything in between 4.3 and 4.3.2 plus 4.6.1 are important.

* *Exercice* with https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/13/docs/specs/man/jshell.html[jshell] (or https://tryjshell.org/[online]):
** Assign 4659 and 23 to variables, and show the result of multiplying these variables
** Show the greatest divisor of 4659 that is different than 4659 (use the `%` operator and a loop)
** Define a method that accepts an integer parameter and returns its greatest divisor except itself; use it to show the greatest divisor of 4659.
** Going beyond: https://arbitrary-but-fixed.net/teaching/java/jshell/2017/12/14/jshell-peculiarities.html[The peculiarities of the JShell]

** ES1.6 (modern UI), 1.7 (internet) [O]
* *Exercice* with a text editor: define a class `MyMathClass` containing the method above and a method that returns the smallest divisor (greater than one) of its parameter; and a class `MyBooleanClass` containing a method `xor` returning `true` iff exactly one of its parameter is `true`. Copy-paste this in jshell and make sure you can call all these methods from jshell. (TODO home)

** http://math.hws.edu/javanotes/contents-with-subsections.html[ES1.1] (machine language), 1.2 (Asynchronous events), 1.3 (JVM)
* *Exercices* (TODO home):
** Add a `main` method to your `MyBooleanClass` that prints “Hello, this is my boolean class.” Use `System.out.println("…")` to print.
** Add a `main` method to you `MyMathClass` that accepts two arguments that can each be either `"true"` or `"false"`; the method calls your `xor` method with the corresponding parameters and prints the result.
** Compile `MyBooleanClass` with https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/13/docs/specs/man/javac.html[javac], move the resulting file into its own folder, execute it from the source folder.
** Find out _in the official documentation_ how to compile the class and let the resulting class be placed in its own folder, in a single step (without you having to move the file afterwards)
** Compile `MyMathClass`, move the resulting file into its own folder (alone), and execute it from the source folder. Why does it fail? What does the error message indicate, and how is it related to the problem? Fix the problem and execute it, first by grouping the class files, second, while keeping both class files in different folders.

[[S5]]
=== S5 (18 March)

* _Non-graded_ programming exercice (Maven; contract; fail fast; objects). Create a personal GitHub repository named `maven-exercice`. Create a Maven project and push your whole project to the GitHub repository (so that the `pom.xml` is at the root of the GitHub repository). Make sure the POM follows the https://github.com/oliviercailloux/java-course/blob/master/Best%20practices/Maven.adoc[best practices] as indicated in the course (hint: use the “Modern project” archetype). Follow https://github.com/oliviercailloux/java-course/blob/master/Best%20practices/Git.adoc[Git Best practices]. 8:35 to 9:35.
** Hint: Use https://github.com/oliviercailloux/java-course/blob/master/Best%20practices/Eclipse.adoc[correct] Eclipse configuration. Check your warnings!
** Create a class having full name `io.github.yourgithubusername.TripletOfDice` (use your GitHub username). This object represents three dice. Its constructor accepts an integer which defines the number of https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Dice_by_number_of_sides[sides] of the dice. Add methods `rollAllDice()` and `rollOneDie(int: dieNumber)` whose parameter must be the integer one, two or three; and methods `getFirstDie(): int`, `getSecondDie(): int` and `getThirdDie(): int`. Determine and write down (in Javadoc) the contracts of these methods and write their code. [Optional: propose a better interface.]
** Create a class `io.github.yourgithubusername.DiceUser` having a static method `rollOnce(): TripletOfDice`. It creates a triplet of six-sided dice, rolls them once, and returns the object representing the triplet.
** In the `DiceUser` class, create a `main` method. It calls `rollOnce()` and prints the result on three lines, as follows (example for a result of 4, 2 and 1): `The die number 1 is a 4`, second line `The die number 2 is a 2`, third line `The die number 3 is a 1`.
** Peer grading:
*** Maven and naming (/1.5): groupId controlled or is mine; package names correspond; Encoding; Java Version (see https://github.com/oliviercailloux/java-course/blob/master/Best%20practices/Maven.adoc[best practices])
*** Git (/1.5) https://github.com/oliviercailloux/java-course/blob/master/Best%20practices/Git.adoc[Best practices]
*** eclipse config (/3) (3 if no warnings and no @SuppressWarnings used, 1.5 if only one warning or @SuppressWarnings used, 0 otherwise)
*** TripletOfDice (/10)
**** rollAllDice indeed rolls all dice, rollOneDie indeed rolls the die, getFirstDie (or getDie) indeed returns the last die result, nothing is static (/3)
**** rollOneDie must throw if die number invalid (/3)
**** better interface (/1, bonus): getDie(int die), must also throw argument if die number invalid. If getDie is there, getFirstDie and similar may have been omitted.
**** Javadoc must mention what happens if I don’t roll and ask for a die (/4). No explanation, or explanation does not match behavior: 0. Example of a consistent explanation and behavior: Javadoc of the class indicates that “A die must be rolled before calling #getDie().”, Javadoc of the method getDie(int) (or of the methods getFirstDie, …) indicates “@throws IllegalStateException if the die is not rolled before calling”, and the code of getDie() indeed throws an IllegalStateException if the die is not rolled before calling.
*** DiceUser (/4)
**** rollOnce is static and performs correctly (/2)
**** main prints exactly the expected text on three lines (/2)

* Inheritance: polymorphism and interfaces; effective type of variables. See https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oliviercailloux/Simple-Papyrus-project/interface/An%20interface%20and%20two%20realizations.svg?sanitize=true[diagram]; import the corresponding https://github.com/oliviercailloux/sample-interface[project] in Eclipse
** http://math.hws.edu/javanotes/contents-with-subsections.html[ES5.5] to 5.8
** *Exercice*: program an interface `MovableObject` with methods `canAccelerate(): boolean`, `accelerate(): void` and `getTimeToMove(double): double`; implement it twice in classes `ConstantSpeedMovable` and `GenericMovable`, in a reasonable way of your choice. In a class `MovableUser`, program a `main` method that instanciates one `ConstantSpeedMovable` and two `GenericMovable` objects, accelerate one of them, and prints the three resulting times to move 1 km. Add a method `brake(): void` to `MovableObject`. Add to `MovableUser` a method `getTotalTime(movable: MovableObject): double` that computes the total time taken for the given movable object to move 1 km then brake then move 100m then accelerate then move 1 km again. Change your `main` so that it also prints that total time, for each of the three objects created in the method. Commit to a repository named `I-like-to-move-it` in your GitHub account.

=== S6 (19 March)

* Inheritance: Object; print an object. See this https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oliviercailloux/Simple-Papyrus-project/inheritance/Object%20and%20Car.svg?sanitize=true[diagram].
** *Exercice*: create an object `Car extends Object` that does not override `toString()`, call its `toString()` method, explain what happens. Override `toString()` in your class `Car`, call the `toString()` method, explain what happens. Consider the following code: `Object car = new Car(); car.toString()`. Will the method be the one declared in `Object` or in `Car`, and why? What changes if we instead write `Car car = new Car(); …`?
* Exceptions: checked and unchecked (see this http://journals.ecs.soton.ac.uk/java/tutorial/java/exceptions/throwable.html[diagram])
** *Exercice*: program a method that draws a random number and throws a `IOException` with one chance on two. Observe that it compiles only if you advertise this exception in the signature. Call this method from another method. Observe that the calling method also must advertise the exception. Change the exception to an `IllegalArgumentException`. Observe that you do not have to advertise this in either method signature.

* http://math.hws.edu/javanotes/c5/exercises.html[EE5.7] (the part about anonymous classes is optional)
//** Supplementary requirements: your code must lie in at least two packages;
//** The idea of this exercice is that you simulate that three different people work on this exercice: one provides some interfaces; another implements the interfaces; a third one uses the interfaces and their implementations to solve the exercice (except you represent all these persons).
//** Declare at least one interface in another Eclipse project, exported as a Java archive (JAR file);
//** implement those interfaces in another Eclipse project, exported as a Java archive (JAR file) (will you need the previous JAR file? Why / why not?);
//** solve the exercices in a third Eclipse project (will you need the previous JAR files? Which ones and why?).

** *Exercice*:
** Program a class `Pair` with generic types `L`, `R` (for Left and Right), that can store a pair of things, one of type `L` and one of type `R`. For example, a `Pair<Double, Integer>` instance can store a `Double` instance and an `Integer` instance.
** Provide methods `getLeft()`, `getRight()`, that each return the appropriate type, and `setContents()`, that admits two parameters and that set both instances of the pair.
** Use your class in a `main` method that creates two `pairs`: one pair of `String` and `Integer` that holds your name and your age, and one pair of double initialized at random values drawn in [0, 1].
** Add a static method `show` that admits any kind of pair as parameter and prints its content (by calling `toString()` on the left and then on the right content of the pair). Use `show` from your main for each of your instances of pair.
** Finally, still from your `main`, create a pair that contains each of your instances of pairs, and give it as an argument to `show`.
** *Exercice*: Implement a `Predicate<String>` to represent a function that associates to a String the value `true` iff its length is even.

* Before end of 22nd of March: push new commit(s) to your `Print exec` repository. You will given a second grade considering the last commit before the deadline. Your final `Print exec` grade will be a weighted sum of your first grade (received previously) and second grade. The weights depend on the number of lines that have changed between these two grades: the weight of the new grade (as a proportion of the full grade) will be 90% if you changed only one line, 70% if two or three lines have changed, 60% for four or five lines, 40% for six or seven lines, 20% for eight or nine lines (and 0% beyond). What counts is the difference between both files *as shown by https://git-scm.com/docs/git-diff#Documentation/git-diff.txt-emgitdiffemltoptionsgtltcommitgtltcommitgt--ltpathgt82308203[git diff], or on https://help.github.com/en/github/committing-changes-to-your-project/comparing-commits#comparing-commits[GitHub]*.

[[S7]]
=== S7 (1 April)

* Peer grading of maven-exercice (https://github.com/oliviercailloux/java-course/blob/master/L3a.adoc#S5{emptyattribute}[S5]), for https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HxDej7S81B3Jgp5VOnct0iw3vO3E6u9HH1les9eg4Vw/edit?usp=sharing[volunteers].
* https://www.scientecheasy.com/2018/09/collection-hierarchy-in-java-collections-class.html[Collections], start: `Iterable` and `Iterator`.
* *Exercices*:
** Define a class `StringPairIterator` that implements `Iterator<String>`. (Is your class a generic type?) Such an object contains (as a field) a `Pair` of `String` (as implemented in the previous exercice), and is able to iterate over a pair of two strings. The first call to `next()` gives the left member, the second call to `next()` gives the right member, and `hasNext()` returns `false` afterwards. Document the contracts of `StringPairIterator` and check that they are compatible with the contracts of `Iterator<E>`. In a `main` method, define a pair, then a pair iterator, and use it to print the two members of the pair. Then, define a class `PairIterator<E>` that implements `Iterator<E>` in a similar way (is this new class generic?). Modify your `main` accordingly.
** Define a class `Pair<E>` (a pair whose two members have the same type). Let your class implement `Iterable<E>`. When asked for an iterator, your pair returns an instance of type `PairIterator<E>`. Define your method header for `iterator()` such that it announces that it returns `Iterator<E>`. Will the compiler accept that you in fact return `PairIterator<E>` when announcing `Iterator<E>`, and if so, will it work at runtime? Check your answer by trying it! Then, change your method header for `iterator()` such that it announces that it returns `PairIterator<E>`. Will the compiler accept that you announce returning `PairIterator<E>` in a class that declares implementing `Iterable<E>` (and thus that should, when asked for `iterator()`, return an `Iterator<E>`), and if so, will it work at runtime? Check your answer by trying it!
** More advanced, and more elegant: instead of defining a class `Pair<E, E>` from scratch, define a class `HomogeneousPair<E, E>` that extends your existing class `Pair<L, R>`. Do the rest of the exercice above.
** Use the https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/for.html[enhanced for (for-each) loop] on iterables and arrays!
* Collections, next: Interfaces extend VS classes implement
** http://math.hws.edu/javanotes/contents-with-subsections.html[ES10] to 10.2
** For this course, use by default: `ArrayList` / `ImmutableList`; `LinkedHashSet` / `ImmutableSet`; `LinkedHashMap` / `ImmutableMap`.
* *Exercices*:
** Make sure you can see from your IDE the javadoc of the JDK and of the libraries you add with Maven, for coding efficiently
//interfaces with generics and collections
** http://math.hws.edu/javanotes/c10/exercises.html[EE10.4] 
// list of words
** http://math.hws.edu/javanotes/c7/exercises.html[EE7.6] (you may use standard input instead of file input)
// set (long)

// read, sort a list
** http://math.hws.edu/javanotes8/c7/exercises.html[EE7.1], 7.5 (except that you can use built-sorting functions from the Java API).
** A class E1 that asks the end-user for a set of integer values. The user enters 0 to stop entering values. Store these values in a Set of Integer values (discarding duplicates). Do it again, obtaining a second set. Then print each set of values entered, then the union of both sets. For example, if the user enters 3, 4, 2, 0, then 1, 1, 2, 5, 0, it prints: 3, 4, 2, then 1, 2, 5, then 3, 4, 2, 1, 5. Use Java sets and interfaces appropriately. [I]
//** Correct E1
//.. découpé en sous-routines ?
//.. contrat général (Collection au lieu de LinkedList) ?
//.. noms complets de classes uniques ?
//.. structures appropriées ? (Set)
//.. réutilisation si on demande les nombres différemment ? (Lus depuis fichiers)
//.. nommage approprié ? (searchNumber renvoie boolean, non, devrait poser une question: isIn)
//.. documentation javadoc lorsque nécessaire ?
//.. utilisation adéquate des structures ? (ne pas rechercher un nombre dans une liste)
//.. conventions respectées ? (noms de variables et méthodes en camelCase, de classes en PascalCase, de packages en minuscules, …)

//.. pas de commentaires inutiles (tq auto-générés //TODO, @author vide, …)
//.. (micro) pas de comparaison à `true` (`if(isBig == true)`)

** *Exercice:* define a class `PairIteratorTests` and a test that creates a pair of integers _(2, 3)_ and a `PairIterator` object to iterate over this pair, and verifies that the iterator gives elements _2_, _3_, and that its `hasNext()` method returns `false` only after the second step.

*TODO home* 

* https://classroom.github.com/a/zHGHjChL[Coffee], submit before end of 5 April. Implement the classes `DripCoffeeMaker` and `MyEspressoMachine`, making sure they satisfy their contracts. You are encouraged to discuss your ideas or doubt with classmates, but you may not share code (any too similar code will be considered cheating and be graded zero). You will be graded automatically. If the code does not compile, the grade is zero. This exercice will have a very low weight if I get a chance to grade sufficiently many exercices after the quarantine or in a better controlled environment (in which case this will be considered essentially as a non graded exercice). Otherwise (if I do not find a better solution), this grade will have a weight similar to other graded exercices.
* You may submit a new solution to print exec on your (existing) print exec repository, you will receive new comments considering your version at the end of 5 April. This will not count for the grade.

** *Exercice*: call the static method `String.link:https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/String.html#format(java.lang.String,java.lang.Object.%2E.)[format]()` with no arguments, then with only one string as argument, then two strings, then three strings. Predict which calls will be accepted by the compiler. Explain in each case what parameters are effectively passed to the method, by considering the method declaration (hint: exactly two parameters are passed for each permissible call).

* https://github.com/oliviercailloux/java-course/blob/master/Best%20practices/Resources.adoc[Resources]; exercice: read a file from the class path.

*Exercices*

* Implement an interface `EasyMap` with two methods: a method that puts a pair of key and value of your choice into a map, and a method that returns an `Optional` containing the value corresponding to the given key (parameter of the method) or that returns an empty `Optional` if there is no such value. Implement this interface in a class `EasyMapImpl`. Provide a static factory method in the interface `EasyMap`. Minimize the number of lines of code (but not at the price of readability). Note that this exercice implements the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forwarding_(object-oriented_programming)[forwarding] pattern.
** Define `MyComparator`, a class that implements a comparator over your values. Add a third method to `EasyMap`, that returns a list of values ordered by that comparator.
