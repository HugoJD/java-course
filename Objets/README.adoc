// ** Supplementary requirement: you will archive `PairOfDice` and `StatCalc` into a JAR file and use this in a new Eclipse project where only one class is defined, which uses `PairOfDice` and `StatCalc`. Commit both projects into your repository (in two separate directories). The structure of your git repository should be as follows. Please follow the exact naming scheme.
// ** `project43/`… (contains `src` with your source code inside a sub-directory of it)
// ** `project47/`… (contains `src` with your source code inside a sub-directory of it)
// ** `project53utils/`… (contains `utils.jar` and `src/` with `PairOfDice` and `StatCalc` inside a sub-directory of it)
// ** `project53main/`… (contains `src/` with you main method)
//* You may use the `groupId` `io.github.<yourgithubusername>`.
